# Quick Notes

Some of the styles are not 100% accurate to the BJCP 2021 style guidelines. This was converted from a docx format and parsed using a complicated script to convert this to JSON format. If you're interested in the script that converted the docx I can post a gist to it.

There is one style, "Saison" that has a slightly different format due to the way the BJCP creates the style, since there is a table, standard and super version and their "Vital Statistics" are formatted a bit strangely, there is a `vitalStatistics` property as well as an options (type wise) `specialStatistics` property to holw the specific differences in "type". The `vitalStatistics` props on this style includes the full range of stats with the specifics being housed in the "Special Statistics".
